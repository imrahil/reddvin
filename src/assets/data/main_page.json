                "selftext": "**AT&amp;T inadvertently and beautifully articulates rationale for a progressive income tax.**\n\nContext: [Press release](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/13/atandt-will-cap-dsl-u-verse-internet-and-impose-overage-fees/)\n\nWe **(The government)** are committed to providing a great experience **(life)** for all of our Internet customers **(citizens)**. Less than 2 percent of our Internet customers could be impacted by this approach - those who are using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth **(a disproportionate amount of money)**. We will communicate early and often with these customers so they are well aware of their options before they incur any additional usage charges **(taxes)**. \n\nThe top 2 percent of residential subscribers uses about 20 percent of the bandwidth **(wealth)** on our network **(planet)**. Just one of these high-traffic users **(multi-billion dollar corporations and individuals)** can utilize the same amount of data capacity **(capital)** as 19 typical households. Lopsided usage patterns **(Lopsided investment schemes)** can cause congestion **(Terrible poverty)**, at certain points in the network, which can slow Internet speeds **(Create a global recession)** and interfere with other customers' access to and use of the network **(Create a global credit market crash)**. Our new plan addresses another concern: customers strongly believe that only those who use the most bandwidth should pay more than those who don't use as much**(Those who make more money should pay more taxes)**. That's exactly what this does \u2013 and again, 98% of our customers **(98% of our citizens)** will not be impacted by this.\n\nEdit: Yes I'm aware it's not a perfect analogy, but its too close to ignore. Also, noticing a lot of people throwing in words they think are more apt. Do more of that, will edit in the more precise ones as the day goes on. ",
